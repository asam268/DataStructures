# DataStructures
Time to write your first README.md. README's are usually included on every software project and document what the 
project does, why the project is useful, etc. README's are written in Markdown files (.md), which provides a lightweight
and easy-to-use syntax for styling forms.

TODO: Research resizable array, stack, queue, and singly/doubly linked lists and document a small description for each
data structure, listing advantages and drawbacks. 

Document all of the above information in this README. Make it look pretty. 
[Here is a cheat sheet for styling .md files.](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
I recommend editing this README in IntelliJ. There you can see a live preview of the README as you write it.

Once you're done, we can circle back and talk about the research you found.
